# healthpage-generator
Proof of concept to verify aligned health checks via source code generator. Source Generator uses `.health.yml` file to generate source code based on [AspNetCore.HealthChecks](https://github.com/Xabaril/AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks) libs.

## Why Source Generator
- Defintion file (`.health.yml`) should not be a dependency during runtime (similar to openapi spec file)
