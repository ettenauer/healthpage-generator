# healthpage-generator
Proof of concept to verify aligned health checks via source code generator. Input file `.health.yml`, which is used to generate source code based on [AspNetCore.HealthChecks](https://github.com/Xabaril/AspNetCore.Diagnostics.HealthChecks) libs.

## Why Source Generator:
- Defintion file (.health.yml) should not be a dependency during runtime (similar to openapi defintion files)
